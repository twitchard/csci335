  1. Cache things!
  2. More servers!

## PART 1 - Caches
---

class: center, middle
## What is a cache?

???

What does a cache give you, and what do you pay for it?

---

class: center, middle
## What types of caches are there?

AKA: Where can caches live?

---

## Where can caches live

* inside the client application
* inside the browser (etags, cache-control header)
* in front of the application (CDN, HTTP reverse proxy)
* inside of the server application process (please don't do this)
* in a key-value store "in front of" the SQL database (redis, memcached)
* inside the SQL database (query cache)

---
## Cache inside the client application
---

## Cache inside the client application

```html
<button onClick="updateData()">get the latest chemistries</button>
<div id="dataGoesHere"></div>
```

### Doesn't use a cache
```javascript
async function updateData () {
    const ids = await getIdsOfLatestChemistriesFromServer()
    const data = []
    for (id of ids) {
        data.push(
            // This calls getChemistryFromServer even if we've
            // already fetched the chemistry the previous time the
            // user clicked
            await getChemistryFromServer(id)
        )
    }
    document.getElementById('dataGoesHere').innerHTML = renderChemistries(data)
}
```

---

### Makes a request only once every 2 minutes
```javascript
let cache = {}
async function getChemistryFromCachedServer (id) {
    if (cache[id] &&
        cache[id].time > Date.now() - TWO_MINUTES
    ) {
        return cache[id].value
    } 
    const value = await getChemistryFromServer(id)
    cache[id] = {value, time: Date.now()}
}
```
---
## Some Javascript front-end frameworks do this by default

"Ember.js" (not that popular, but influential)

## The Browser Cache

* The server can ask the browser to cache a response by providing a "cache-control header".

* Skim (but probably don't read) [the RFC about caching.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234)

## Cache-control examples:
* Example:

```sh
$ curl wikipedia.org -I -L -s | grep cache-control
cache-control: s-maxage=86400, must-revalidate, max-age=3600
```

`max-age=3600` means that browsers can cache the page for an hour.

???
If you visited the Wikipedia landing page, and then somebody made an edit, you would not see it until an hour later.

Unless you cleared your cache, or opened an incognito window.

---
```
## More cache-control examples

**The article about caching is not cached at all (by browsers)**
```
$ curl 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)' -I -s | grep cache-control
cache-control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
```

**But the "Wikimedia Foundation" image that is on every wikipedia article is cached for AGES.**
```
curl 'https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button-2x.png' -s -I | grep cache-control
cache-control: max-age=31536000
```

## ETags

Etags are a way for the server to avoid retransmitting large responses. An etag is like a "version number" for the response.

1. The server provides an etag header.

2. The client remembers the response and the etag.

3. When the client asks again, they specify the etag in the "If-None-Match" header.

4. If the old response is up-to-date, the server can check that the etag is current, and then say
"304 not modified", instead of retransmitting a big file.

- This is important for images and other media.
- Etags are usually a hash/checksum of the file contents.

???
Ok, so browser caches only help reduce duplicate traffic from each client. But if I have a million different Taylor Swift fans, how do I handle that?
---

## Public caches

- Browser caches are 'private' caches.
- Reduce duplicate traffic from a single client.
- But Taylor Swift's 83 million followers aren't all using a single browser.

---

## Public caches

Public caches are shared across many users. One example: Varnish.

---
class
## What does Varnish do

- It is very very very fast at sending and receiving HTTP requests. 20,000+ requests per second, possibly.
- Goes "in front" of your application server.
- Stores responses 
- Can protect the application server from returning any response more than once.

## Cache terminology
* **Cache hit** the requested object was in the cache
* **Cache miss** the requested object was not in the cache
* **Cache bust** to remove an object from the cache (before it expires)
* **Warm the cache** to put an object in the cache, so it can be ready before a real client requests it
